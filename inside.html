<h4> &nbsp;Health Care </h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
High-quality health-care is each one of us would want in case of medical 
emergency. Rising medical costs and skyrocketing insurance premiums can 
make it difficult to afford quality medical care. In Indian Navy, we pride 
ourselves in providing world-class medical care to each and every Sailor 
and Officer – as well as their families. This full, comprehensive coverage is 
available at all military hospitals and dental facilities.</p>

<h4> &nbsp;Explore the world </h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The ships and submarines of the Indian Navy often visit a number of 
foreign ports. The men who serve on these platforms get to visit the 
numerous foreign ports that these ships and submarines visit.</p>

 <h4> &nbsp;Recreational Facilities</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Sailors and Officers alike have access to free and low-cost recreational 
facilities. As a Sailor or Officer working on the ship or a base, it’s not just 
all work and no play. You will have the opportunity to work and live with 
other service members, as well as rest and relax away from the job.</p>
